# Package/release guidance for Go binary

Define release packaging for Go: build instructions (darwin/arm64, amd64, linux), versioning tied to JUSTVIBIN_VERSION, binary naming, checksum generation, and optional Homebrew tap formula steps. Document in docs/release.md. No actual publishing required yet.

## Acceptance Criteria

- docs/release.md (or similar) describes build matrix and commands\n- Versioning guidance linked to source constant\n- Notes on checksums and optional brew tap steps\n- No publishing performed
