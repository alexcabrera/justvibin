# Update README/docs for Go binary

Refresh documentation for Go-based CLI: installation (go install, prebuilt binary path, brew tap optional), usage examples for new/templates/help/version, mention Charm UI deps (lipgloss/log/huh/bubbles) and no external gum dependency, config path (~/.config/justvibin/templates.toml), requirements (git, Go version). Deprecate Bash install snippet. Ensure docs reflect current default templates and next-steps output. Add note on building from source and running tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- README updated for Go install/usage and requirements\n- Mentions Charm UI deps and config path\n- Removes/updates Bash download instructions\n- Examples reflect Go binary commands
