# Update Homebrew formula

Update the Homebrew formula in alexcabrera/homebrew-tap.

## File

/Users/acabrera/Code/homebrew-tap/Formula/justvibin.rb

## Updated Formula

```ruby
class Justvibin < Formula
  desc "CLI for scaffolding and serving web projects with automatic HTTPS"
  homepage "https://github.com/alexcabrera/justvibin"
  url "https://github.com/alexcabrera/justvibin/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.tar.gz"
  sha256 "<calculate-after-release>"
  license "MIT"

  depends_on "bash" => "4.0"
  depends_on "jq"
  depends_on "caddy"

  def install
    bin.install "justvibin"
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      To complete setup, run:
        justvibin setup

      This will configure the HTTPS proxy and trust certificates.

      For a better UI experience:
        brew install gum

      For public tunnels:
        brew install cloudflared
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "justvibin v#{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/justvibin --version")
  end
end
```

## Steps

1. Wait for v1.0.0 release
2. Download tarball and calculate SHA256
3. Update formula
4. Test: brew install --build-from-source
5. Push to homebrew-tap

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Formula updated with v1.0.0 URL
- [ ] SHA256 calculated correctly
- [ ] Dependencies added (jq, caddy)
- [ ] Caveats updated
- [ ] Installation tested
