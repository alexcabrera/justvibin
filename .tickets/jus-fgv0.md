# Add test for port auto-detection

Create manual or automated test to verify port auto-detection works correctly when multiple justvibin projects attempt to start on the same port.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Test starts two projects with same default port
- Second project auto-selects different port
- Both projects accessible via their .localhost URLs
- Caddy correctly routes to each backend
